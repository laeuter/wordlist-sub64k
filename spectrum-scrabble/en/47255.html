        english.specwl2 represents a word list suitable for playing German Scrabble(R)-like games.
        Word forms are accepted, proper names are disallowed.
        Word selection was directed by usage count in Scrabble (R) games.
        Construction:
        * determine the most useful ending sets for the wordlist, especially for words up to 5 letters
        * as long as the compressed wordlist satisfies the size constraint, add words, from most frequently played to least frequently played; use the best of the available ending sets
        * an entry is encoded like this:
          1 byte op: bits W KKKKK N E
            - KKKKK = number of letters to keep from the previous entry
            - N = flag, if literal letters follow
            - W = the kept letters + literal letters form a valid word
            - E = a byte with the index of the index set follows. Otherwise no endings apply.
          1 byte ending set index, if E was set
          if N ist set, some bytes literal letters, last byte has bit 7 set
          => This entry encodes a root of KKKKK + some letters. This is a word if W = 1. Each ending of the ending set is appended to the root, and each string provides a word.
        * In order to make this compress well, entries are sorted alphabetically before being encoded
        * op = 0 ends the entries
        * The ending sets follow: each ending set is encoded the same way as above, until 0-byte (or 1 if it is the last byte of the file)
        * The last byte of the file is the index of the ending set only consisting of the empty string.
        * Words encoded by different entries may overlap (they are not in alphabetical order, either), but hey, creating additional restricted ending sets takes space
        * Compression is heavily inspired by the 1987 Sinclair Spectrum 128 program 'Computer Scrabble De Luxe' by Leisure Genius (https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/software/games/scrabble-deluxe-leisure-genius) who packed a 20521-word wordlist in 25956 bytes. They even represented a reduced wordlist by using op=0 to end the reduced portion of a starting letter, continuing by the extended portion until the first letter changed. The wordlist ended by two 0 bytes. This scheme invented by Irwan Owen & John Mullins compresses significantly better than any DAWG compression, at least for German Scrabble wordlists, they are heros! DAWG is still faster to walk and has no duplicates.
