There've been programs on 8-bit computers that played word games such as Scrabble (R). They must have used word lists, and they surely must have been handcrafted, striking a balance between memory pressure and fast execution.

Today some of the problems have gone, today word game programs cannot play at full strength due to copyright issues on the official word lists. I am not advocating for or against here, official word lists have to be published and professionally cared for, those people should be recompensated in a sensible manner.

Restricted word lists today are merely just fun. But the proposed size should be so small that word selection (that's what a copyright is on – you surely cannot copyright words, can you?) is so completely different than that of the copyrighted lists, that the restricted word lists are just different. Or does the copyright on an official word list cover all smaller sublists, esp. *much* smaller ones?

I think, we are in the fun domain here. And – if the words are selected appropriately – the word lists here can be used by aspiring authors of word game programs as training sets and/or word lists that the programs can be published with, without touching copyright/patent issues.

Restricted word lists can be restricted in so many ways:
* languages,
* suitability for different word games (or none at all),
* different size categories,
* different data structured, using additional compression or not.

So I propose structuring this repository by disciplines (one folder per discipline) and no discipline being better than another. Inside a discipline there can be competitions or just collections of different propositions – every author has the right on his own maximizing criterium!

To be usable for others every entry should be accompanied by a program demonstrating the usage of the data file: decompression (if there is one) and a demo program in a HTML page (perhaps containing JS), perhaps demoing how to list all the list's contents. This demo page might contain some explanation about the beauty of the construction and the author's use scenario.

The word selection is perhaps the most ingenious thing of a proposition. Authors are free to share their approaches, but no consumer has the right on a complete tool chain leading to the data file.

Have fun!
